## Introduction
The data used in this assignment is from the Young Lives: an International Study of Childhood Poverty project, collected by the U.K. Data Service. This is a longitudinal dataset following two cohorts of children every 3-4 years from 2002 to 2016 in India. The specific data used in this project is from 2006 and focuses on two states on India's east coast, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

The project’s key objectives are to “improve the understanding of causes and consequences of childhood poverty and to inform and the development and implementation of future policies and practices that will reduce childhood poverty” (Young Lives). This project will discuss a few of the key variables and relationships relevant to childhood poverty in India.

## Child Body Mass Index and Household Food Expenditures
This first visualization looks at the relationship between household expenditure on food and their children's Body Mass Index (BMI). I would expect that children with higher BMIs are from households that spend more on food. In the context of poor, often rural Indian households, increased expenditure on food can imply more purchases of healthier and fresher foods which are usually more expensive.

We see that in this sample, most children's BMI is between 10 and 16. According to BMI standards, children with a BMI below 18.5 is considered to be underweight. Though this visualization only considers two variables, it does establish a potential relationship to consider in addressing children's health related to improving households' ability to increase food spending versus non-food spending.
